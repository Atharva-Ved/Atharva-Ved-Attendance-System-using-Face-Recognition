# Atharva-Ved-Attendance-System-using-Face-Recognition
This project is an automated attendance system that uses face recognition technology to mark attendance. The system captures real-time images of individuals, recognizes their faces, and records their presence. This eliminates the need for manual attendance marking, making the process more efficient, accurate, and secure.
